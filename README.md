# Anurag Kumar – Resume Repository

Hi, I'm Anurag Kumar, a third-year B.Tech student in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIT Bhubaneswar.  
I’m passionate about hardware design, embedded systems, simulation, and circuit design — both digital and analog.  

This repository contains my resume, along with summaries of my technical skills, academic projects, and engineering experience.

## Technical Interests

- Digital system design (Verilog, FSMs, FPGA implementation)
- Analog circuit design (Op-Amps, LDOs, BGR, OTAs)
- Communication systems (modulation techniques, circuit simulation)
- Modeling and control (Simulink, MATLAB)
- Embedded systems and low-level programming (Arduino, C/C++)
